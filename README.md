CS 3350 Software Engineering Game Project
C++ and OpenGL

Description

- In our Summer Software Engineering Class, we were given a project to create a game using vanilla OpenGL and C++ within 6 weeks.

- The main file is game.cpp
- Each member has their own .cpp file where they can add external functions to call from the main game.cpp file.
- Each member has their own file in order to make it easier for the instructor to grade groups and track progress
